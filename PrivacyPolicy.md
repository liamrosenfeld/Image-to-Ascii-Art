## Information Collection and Use

This app does not collect or store any personally identifiable information. The only user data stored off the device is ASCII art generated in the iMessage extension. It is stored without without any personally identifiable information. The data stored is critical for the functionality of the iMessage extension because the text is to large to send solely within iMessage. It is hosted using Apple's CloudKit.

I value your trust, thus am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
